					<p>Fasten your seatbelt and listen. That red light up ahead marks a place of grave danger. Do not stop! [acceleration sounds and a crash] In four point two miles, turn right, on Lincoln. Then move to the left lane to prepare for a turn on to Hay Street. Your destination will be a half-mile on the right. I remember there was a bard named Hays who used to trouble Ogden for soup and boarding in the summer months.
Ogden had a rule about minstrels that went back 20 years to when Baerna ran the inn. Baerna was a cruel inkeep but a fine cook. Not a soul in Westmarch would disagree.
A case could be made that Westmarch created the notion of Frontier Cousine from the first days of Zakarum's push into that region.
Not that the followers of Akarat knew what would come from their expansion into the West. No, the impact of that campaign would not be understood for generations, yes. Our travels together are at an end, my friend. You've reached your destination.</p>
