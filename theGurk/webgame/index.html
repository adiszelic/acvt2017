		<h2> You have reached the last hole and you have the chance to win your first tournament.
		 It is really windy and you are starting to feel the nerves. You and your opponent are 
		 walking from the tee after two good drives in the middle of the fairway.
		You have to score a birdie to win the tournament and have a small chance to reach the green
		 but then you need to take a risky shoot. 
		<br><br>What do you do?	</h2>
